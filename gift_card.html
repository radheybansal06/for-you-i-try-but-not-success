          <strong>My Tortoise... (Torto) Meri Jaan ❤️</strong>
          <p>
            Do you remember today's date? 🤭🤭<br />
            Happy 9 Month Relationship!<br /><br />
            I really wish I was with you right now, celebrating it together.  
            I love you so much and miss you even more. 🥺<br /><br />
            These 9 months have been the most precious time of my life. ❤❤❤<br />
            I hope the years ahead are even more beautiful for both of us.<br /><br />
            Do you remember why I call you my Tortoise? 🤭🤭 I'm smiling just thinking of those moments.<br />
            I’m missing your lap, you making me sleep in your arms, 
            and that time you lifted me weightlessly and kissed me while sitting on the cupboard. 😘😘😘<br /><br />
            Let’s celebrate these 9 months — maybe with drinks? 😅😅  
            (Okay, non-alcoholic ones will do 🤭🤭😘)<br />
            I wish we live happily together forever 🥰🥰🥰
